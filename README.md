Summary: This project is for a restaurant business. We were asked to build an interactive 
website where a user can navigate through different pages. The user can go to a menu,
reservation, account, and order page. By the end of the project a customer will be able 
to login to or create an account, place an order, and place reservations without issues.
There will also be methods in place to make sure user input information is valid.

Instructions: Run the program from mainGUIController, GUI will pop up.
Click through the different pages to see what can be done!

Build: JavaFx, SceneBuilder, Intellij
